# Kildare-to-Discover
Final Year Project.

Kildare To Discover is a Native Android tourism application specifically based on places and current events in county Kildare. 

Features include Google Map integration, Location based Weather, live 'what's happening now' schedules, 
with a modern (as of 2015) UI.

The project was complete as part of a final year Computer Science module using Eclipse Android (Java 7),
RESTful web services, Google Play Services API's (Maps + Location), SQLite database, JSON notation and tested using JUnit
- and is the perfect mobile tool for planning some time out in the thoroughbred county.
