# Kildare-to-Discover
Final Year Project.

Kildare To Discover is an Android tourism application specifically based on places and current events in county Kildare. 

Features include Google Map integration, Location based Weather information, live 'what's happening now' schedules, 
with a modern and tidy UI.

The project was complete as part of a final year Computer Science module using Eclipse Android (Java 7),
RESTful web services, Google Play Services API's (Maps + Location), SQLite database, JSON notation and tested using JUnit
- and is the perfect mobile tool for planning some time out in the thoroughbred county.
